  SYDA seamlessly generates realistic synthetic test
  data—including structured, unstructured, PDF, and
  HTML—using AI and large language models. It preserves
  referential integrity, maintains privacy compliance, and
  accelerates development workflows. SYDA enables both
  highly regulated industries such as healthcare and
  banking, as well as non-regulated environments like
  software testing, research, and analytics, to safely
  simulate diverse data scenarios without exposing sensitive
  information.
